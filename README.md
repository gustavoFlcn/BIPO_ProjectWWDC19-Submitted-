The project submitted to scholarship is a project whose purpose is to give the impression of how to help a person with bipolarity in a specific phase, the phase of depression. A puzzle game was created, where each piece represents the attitudes of who is playing, and when the challenge is completed it means the help that the player has given. Upon completing the challenge the character within the game appears with a cheerful face, to show that the actions that the person has helped her. There are pieces that bad attitudes, but they are not accepted as an option within the game, to mean that you have this option in real life, but you should not use it.
